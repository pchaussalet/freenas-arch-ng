# Dr Devops ou: Comment j'ai arrêté de m'en faire et j'ai appris à aimer la prod

## Whoami

## Who
- Who's in charge of production ?
- Who's involved in a software project ?
- WTF ?

## You are here
### Waterfall
It works ! (for bridges)
### Agile
It works ! (for devs)
### Devops
Really ?

## First was waterfall
Building software or building bridges, it's all about building, isn't it ?
(Unless users changed their mind...)

## Agile is THE solution !
Having business and developers work hand by hand to meet users needs.
(And sometimes deliver to users...)

## Let's talk to those beard guys
Delivering to end users as fast as developers release features.
(And get cash as fast as possible)

## Where to go now ?
## Give opportunity to understand others job
- One tool to rule them all
- Show what's under the hood
- Give devs an inner view of what's happening
## Involve everybody in everyone's job
- Invite ops to devs standups
- Invite devs to ops nightly interventions (specially deployment)
- Add devs phone number in alerting system
## Don't fear yourself
- Move fast...
- ... break things
- Deliver fast, deliver often
- Automate things
- Test automation
- Put yourself under fire
## Communicate
- Communicate
- COMMUNICATE !!
